# leaflet-challenge

Developed mapping code to help the United States Geological Survey (USGS) plot earthquake data on a map to help visualize the data.  Used data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed to collect data from earthquakes that have occurred over the last week.  Earthquakes magnitude is reflected by the size of the circle marker (larger circles are larger magnitudes), and the depth by the color (darker colors are from greater depth).  In part two of the challenge, added additional tile layers that can be selected, and made the earthquake data a seperate overlay that can be turned on or off.

Uploaded starter code

First Commit - Coded Leaflet Challenge 1, just need to finish Legend, added folder for Leaflet Challenge 2

Second Commit - Added Legend to Leaflet Challenge 1, created coding for different maps and earthquake overlay in Challenge 2

Third Commit - Updated map layers in Challenge 2 because the old ones stopped working
